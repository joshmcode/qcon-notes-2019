## How to scale leadership

### Leadership isn't management
The phrase "you aren't ready to step into a leadership role" is fundamentally flawed. 

**Leadership vs. Management**: Management is about people, stability, etc. 

Leadership is about empathy, inspiration, etc. 

> Leadership is working with goals and vision. Management is about meeting objectives. 

A story that relays leadership is the Manhattan Project: Leslie Groves and Oppenheimer. 

### Some of my own thoughts
Am I truly leading in my team? Or am I looking out for myself? 

Manager tootls: Provide Visibility -> Invite Discussions -> Wait and Repeat -> Sponsor and Reward 

### Can Anyone Be a Leader
Do traits define a leader? 

Supposed leaders:
- Bezos
- Musk
- Zuckerberg
etc...

None of these people have the supposed "leadership traits."

## Real Leadership
Passion is leadership fuel. 

### Blue Flame:
> Perfect alignment between individual passion and organizational need. 

### Motivators
Internal motivators, external motivators, and feedback. 

> Use your good judgment in all situtations. There will be no additional rules. - Nordstrom

Set the culture. 

### Sponsoring and Mentoring
Sponsoring indicates investing financially into someone, where mentoring is more about personal investment. Both are good. 

### Change
Leadership embraces change

> Leaders make new leaders

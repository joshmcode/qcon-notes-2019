GRACEFUL DEGRADATION AS A FEATURE
Lorne Kligerman

## We expect technology to work

We depend on it, but it will break. 

75% of apps are used once and never used again. 

## Why are failures so common? 

- Legacy systems
- Lack of testing
- With scale comes complexity

See the Amazon and Netflix dpendency maps

Its no longer the days where failures are an inconvenience. 

Random thought: even when evolutionists talk about change over time, the speak in terms of design... the system "decided to" or the "organism developed" (intentional) "some things"

## Designing for Failure
My note: there seems to be several key design goals: 
1. Secure
2. Fail-safe
3. Efficient
4. Functional

Break things on purpose

## Common Failure Modes
- Error codes
- Blackhole
- Latency (we only have control over the network to the point where it leaves the machine we're running from). 

## Degrade Gracefully
* Provide the best possible experience
* All but the most critical functionality can fall off

## Delight Your Users

# FROM RESEARCH TO PRODUCTION WITH PYTORCH
Jeff Smith

## Facebook and AI
400 trillion preductions per day
1 Billion phones

## What is PyTorch
A tool Facebook developed to solve their ML problems. 
Eager means Python first. 

* Eager & Graph-based execution
* Dynamic Neural Networks
* Distributed training
* Hardware accelerated inference
* Simplicity over complexity focus

## Research to Production
TORCH.JIT

Definition: 
* Hardware efficiency
* Scalability
* Cross-Platform
* Reliability

colab Google project

Why extract out extract out PyTorch? 
* Platform independent
* Same inputs and outputs

This is essentially DevOps for AI. From the model -> C++ inference service for phones. 

## Examples: 

* Cancer prevention vaccines
* Predictive Driver Assistance

## Ecosystem
Libraries: Optimization problems

Hyperparameter optimizations

## Resources for Developers
* BoTorch
* PyText
* Full Stack Approach

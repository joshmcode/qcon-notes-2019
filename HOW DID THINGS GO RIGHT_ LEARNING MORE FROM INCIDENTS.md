# HOW DID THINGS GO RIGHT? LEARNING MORE FROM INCIDENTS
Ryan Kitchens, Netflix

## Background
- SLO and SLIs (what are these?)

## Failure is so important...
... that it's no longer interesting. 

Success is the other half of the story and needs to be told. 

The surprising thing is not that things are failing, but that they work at all. 

- We're pretty good at preventing incidents
- The most important thing we can learn is how to build the capacity to encounter failure successfully
- 9s don't matter if customer's aren't happy

> There is no panacea (except for expertise)

## There is no root cause
Another way to describe this is "a perfect storm." 

## Pillars of Fallacy
- Comprehension
    - Incidents cannot be fully comprehended
    - They are fraught with uncertainty
    - Remediation items will contribute to further incidents
- Understandability
    - Managing the small stuff does not prevent incidents
    - Incdents are not made up of causes. 
- Predictability
    - Learning from the last incident will not allow you to predict the next one

## Laplace's Demon
- Why do we think we can know everything? 

> Ask more of 'how' than 'why'

5 whys is a competitive disadvantage. The why's can sometimes be limiting because it leaves out information. Asking "how" tells the story and leaves the important info in tact. 

There is no weird trick that will work. 

## Right vs. Wrong
Make sure things go right instead of trying to preven them from going wrong (wow, that's really good). 

### Normal work: 
When everything goes right, pay attention. 

> What if the real success were the incidents we made along the way.

# THE TROUBLE WITH LEARNING IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS
Jason Hand

## Learning
Learning in complex environments is hard

## System Types
Ordered and unordered systems

### Ordered
Two further breakdowns
* Obvious systems (like a bycicle - we know how it works)
* Complicated (a motorcycle - we don't really know how it works)

Who is Arthur Eddington. 

### Unordered
* Complex: take the motorcycle from above and put it on the road with people and cars and signals. You cannot really understand that. 

(side note: chaotic, which is NYC).

## Sociotechnical Systems
The people part is the hard part. 

> In complex systems, causality can only be examined, understood, and determined in ... hindsight. 

Examples of this include the human body. There are:
1. Brain specialists
2. Heart specialists etc. 

Examles include: 
1. Application specialists
2. Database specialists

But these people don't understand the general model of what we're looking at. 

We all have to look at the view from a higher level. 

You cannot just read a book to be able to play an instrument. You need both success and failure. 

#### Note to self: it's okay to be a generalist overall... but then maybe have some areas where I am an expert. 

## Learning opportunities: 
We learn alot about code commits, config changes and somewhat about feature releases because the frequency of these events is high to medium. If you think about it, code commits are easily rolled back. But things like feature releases 

The point of incident reviews are not action items, it's to better understand the system. 

> Prevention is a fool's game. 

Systems are continuously changing. It is better to focus on _minimizing_ impact.

Incidents are the continuous feedback of your complex systems. 

## Techniques to Learn
> Root cause analysis is insufficient. 

Book to Read: Post-Incident Reviews by Jason Hand

Asking about that one thing that went wrong is not the right approach. 

1. Mental models 
2. Language
3. Tools
4. Confidence
5. Knowledge & Info

Combine these five together
```
                            0 0
                            \ /
                            0
                            / \
                            0 0
```

These stories during an incident are not linear. 

To Read: Samuel Arbesman's book: Overcomplicated.

## Operation Knowledge and Mental Models
1. The first is how we get work done. 

2. The latter is how systems work. 

## Exploration and Experimentation
- Learning Reviews. We must find our own ways to learn about what's happening in our systems. 

- Experimentation: Game Days/ Chaos

### Learning Reviews
- Set Context: just trying to learn
- Extract reality
- Invite broader and a more diverse group in
    - Ask more than why
- Allow for time
- Spread the conversation out
    - Allow for reflection and synthesis

## Increase Knowledge and Mental Models

### Game Days
- No pain no gain
- We have to rehearse and practice
- Decrease blind spots
- Let's see what happens to _us_ when we take the system down. 

### One Last Thing... 
It just takes one person. 

Software isn't built like cars. Why would we try to build it the same way.

The systems we are using today are continuously being relied on, and are relient on, other systems and things in the world.

# Are We Really Cloud Native
Bert Ertman

## What Is Cloud Native
"Blah, bla, bla... Kubernetes"

Java EE is dead, long live Cloud!

This statement is no longer true: 

> There is no cloud, just someone else's computer

IaaS, PaaS, and Serverless

## Serverless
Managed middleware

The cloud spectrum
- SaaS -> IaaS -> PaaS -> Serverless -> Cloud Native

## The World
What is happening in the rest of the world? 

> Software is eating the world

Our answers so far:
- Business agility = Microservices
- Infrastructure = CI/CD + containers
- Process = Agile + DevOps

80-90% of IT budgets are spent on maintaining existing systems. 

Modularization is good, but not to make things complex to just be complex. 

## Tradeoffs of Decomposition
How to deal with:
- Testing?
- Configure?
- Dependencies?
- Versioning?
- Latency and overhead
- Monitoring?

## DevOps
The problem with DevOps: dinasours 

What do orgs do? They try to standardized everything... Which isn't bad, because in many ways we are able to create a "waterline" that helps team focus. 

However, it can also cause problems. 

## Cloud-Native is a DevOps journey
* Cloud-native is the architecture for assembling cloud-based components in a way that is optimized for the cloud environment. 

* Its not about servers but services

## Legos
* The blocks: PaaS, Serverless, and Iaas. 

* Start assembling from the top down. For example, start with serverless. If something doesn't fit, go to the PaaS. Then if that is missing something go to IaaS. 

## So what is cloud-native? 
* Technologies are not cloud-native. Its the way you use them. 


## Getting the best from the Cloud

* Focus on strategic value, vs. managing infrastructure and middleware. 

* Ability to easily experiment with new technology or new business ideas? 

* Potential for economic disruption

It could easily be standing up our own Kubernetes... and it could also be about just using the Cloud. 

Friends don't let friends build their own Kubernetes platform. 

## Is Java still a natural fit?
A better question is "are Java programmers a good fit for the cloud?" Hopefully its not the only skill we have. 

## Change of Pace
We have to learn more faster. 

## Cloud Native Culture Killers
* Business does not trust IT, so no true BizDevSecOps
* IT is a cost center
* We only do cloud because it saves us money (we think)

## Cloud-Native Culture FTW

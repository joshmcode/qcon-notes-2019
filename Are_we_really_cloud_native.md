# Are We Really Cloud Native

## What Is Cloud Native
"Blah, bla, bla... Kubernetes"

Java EE is dead, long live Cloud!

This statement is no longer true: 

> There is no cloud, just someone else's computer

IaaS, PaaS, and Serverless

## Serverless
Managed middleware

The cloud spectrum
- SaaS -> IaaS -> PaaS -> Serverless -> Cloud Native

## The World
What is happening in the rest of the world? 

> Software is eating the world

Our answers so far:
- Business agility = Microservices
- Infrastructure = CI/CD + containers
- Process = Agile + DevOps

80-90% of IT budgets are spent on maintaining existing systems. 

Modularization is good, but not to make things complex to just be complex. 

## Tradeoffs of Decomposition
How to deal with:
- Testing?
- Configure?
- Dependencies?
- Versioning?
- Latency and overhead
- Monitoring?

## DevOps
The problem with DevOps: dinasours 

What do orgs do? They try to standardized everything... Which isn't bad, because in many ways we are able to create a "waterline" that helps team focus. 

However, it can also cause problems. 

## Cloud-Native is a DevOps journey
* Cloud-native is the architecture for assembling cloud-based components in a way that is optimized for the cloud environment.

# THE_NOT-SO-STRAIGHTFORWARD_ROAD_FROM_MICROSERVICES_TO_SERVERLESS

Meetup

## Transitions
His experience: monolith -> microservices -> serverless

## Definitions
What is a microservice?

> Microservices seem to be highly-distributed application architectures. 

What is serverless?

> Who knows? 

Book: what is serverless by O'Reilly

Keep your monolith for as long as possible and slowly migrate features into microservices as needed. 

What happens if you waited so long there are other alternatives? 

## Meetup 
A big monolith called "chapstick." They tried Kubernetes locally and microservices but that failed. 

The company was acquired by a company called chapstick. 

TODO: Play around with Azure functions. 

## How can we keep the good and get rid of the bad?

## Pinball machine architecture
Martin Fowler: Public versus Publishes Interfaces. 

> How to handle the explosion of lambdas? 

They tried to split up the Lambdas into different API gateways. This somewhat looks like microservices, but it prevents unstructured systems. 

## Use Serverless as building blocks for Microservices

However, API Gateways are actually expensive on AWS. 

AWS has a lot of internal strife between teams. 

## The Future
Is this the future? Who cares. 

He thinks serverless is the future, but who cares.

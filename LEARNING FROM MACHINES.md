# Learning From Machines
Ashi Krishnan

## Description
A talk about the relationship between human cognition and machine cognition. The general conclusion of the tlak is that people are essentially just complex processes. 

## What stood out to me
Excellent speaker. The use of visuals was very good (although it did make me uncomfortable, but I think that was the intent).

Ashi also did a great job of explaining complex subject matter, such as how the human brain qualifies and quantifies imagery and how this relates to Neural Nets.
